# Taking-Images-Object-by-Robotic-Arm
The Python program has been designed to run at the allocated hours of each member of Team 4 automatically . It first starts by retrieving the system time of the executing host and compares it to the hard-coded times for each member. If the system time does not coincide with members' time, the program will inform the user through Standard Output and close. Otherwise, the program will continue with the Execution Procedure.  Execution Procedure  Before proceeding to move to the initial position above the object, it will configure itself to a position deemed safest (Avoids all obstacles when moving to the position). Next, it will proceed to iterate through calculated coordinate points (TMOVETO) to capture an image of each square centimeter of the top and front face. Prior to moving to the front face for capturing, the program instructs the arm to back to our designated neutral position. After completing all co-ordinate based movements (TMOVETO), the arm will return to the neutral position and proceed to re-capture each square centimeter through direct-angular manipulation (AJMA). Upon completion of all four steps in the execution procedure, the arm returns to the neutral position, then HOME.
